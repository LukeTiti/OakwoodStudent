# OakwwodStudent

This is a combined project in between Carl-Philip Arnold and Luke Titi to help the Oakwood Sophmore Class. The website creates a new way for Students to help each other by uploading notes so that other students can make sure their notes have the correct/all of the information. The app creates a brand new Veracross view with a To Do page where you can keep track of assignments you havent completed yet.


This Project, both the app and website are in beta/prototyping stages and do not refelct a completed product.
